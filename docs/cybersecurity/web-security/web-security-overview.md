# Web Security Overview
## Introduction
There are high chances that you are using your desktop, laptop or tab etc. to open a page to get some information like:

1. Search Google through browser
2. Login to Social media like twitter, facebook or even web version of WhatsAPP
3. YouTube to watch movie or songs
4. Almost anything that you open through browser is actually a website.

So, now you know what is a website. So, every website wil have unique address, that you type on browser. We call it url as well.
From now onwards, we will interchangeably use website or url.

## What is Web Security
I have few questions for you when you open a website. 

1. How would you make sure, you opened a correct website and not the fake one?
2. You enter your personal data to the website, are you sure it's not hacked by someone else?
3. How would you trust a website before entering your details? Just through https? Well, https is one of the many known ways to secure the website.
4. Do you wonder what is https?
5. Are you curious to know how the data is transferred or stored securely from attackers?

If, you know the answers of above questions; it means you are good to go with web security basics and would make your journey easier while learning web security concepts.
